# Quickstart



## **2 options** are available:

### 1. Binary runtime

Scripts used checkmate CLI binary (python based)

Below are the checkmate current parameters:

Explanation of Parameters

```--backend:```

Specifies the backend type.

Choices: "sql" (default), "sqlite".

Example: --backend sql

```--backend-opts:```

Provides backend-specific options, such as the connection string for an SQL database or file path for SQLite.

Example for SQL: --backend-opts "postgresql://user:password@localhost/mydatabase"

Example for SQLite: --backend-opts "sqlite:///path/to/database.db"

defaults to memory store if not set for SQLite

```--path:```

Specifies the path to create the new project. Defaults to the current working directory if not specified.

Example: --path "/path/to/project"

```--pk:```

Sets the primary key for the project. If not provided, a UUID is generated.

Example: --pk "my_custom_primary_key"

Example Usage

To create a project with a SQL backend and a specific connection string:

```checkmate --backend sql --backend-opts "postgresql://user:password@localhost/mydatabase" --path "/path/to/project" --pk "custom_pk"```



#### CLI output

Run in command prompt in your Git repository folder:

`sh <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tcosolutions/betterscan/main/cli.sh)`

### HTML, JSON, SARIF output

The result will be in the current directory in "report.html", "report.json" and "report.sarif" file

Run in command prompt in your Git repository folder:
  
`sh <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tcosolutions/betterscan/main/cli-html.sh)`

### 2. Platform with Webinterface and workers

#### Docker

If you need CI/CD and Web Interface, you need Docker-Compose installed as well, if you don't already have it.

Run in command prompt:

```
git clone git@github.com:tcosolutions/betterscan.git
cd betterscan/dockerhub
docker compose up
```

#### Kubernetest / Minikube

Installable via helm chart.
